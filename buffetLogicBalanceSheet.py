#Balance Sheet is a snapshot of the company of a given date



#current assets

#inventory sold > accounts receivable > Cash > Inventory





#cash and cash equivalents
#Rule: lots of cash and marketable securities with litte/no debt, business is strong
# if hurting for cash and lots of debt, probably sinking ship
#look at past 7 years of balance sheets
#if cash created by one time event or ongoing business ops
#compare cash and cash equivalents with debt


#inventory

#advantage when inventory and net earnings both rise together year on year


#inconsistent inventory is bad





#Net receievables

#Recievables - bad debt = net recievables

# if company consistently shows lower % of net recievables to gross sales than competitors
#usually has advantage

#compare against competitors






#Prepaid expenses/other current assets
#little information on performance




#total current assets and current ratio


#current ratio = current assets/current liabilites
#higher, the more liquid
#over 1 is good, below 1 is bad

#some companies like coca cola with really strong earnings have a lower ratio below 1, exception.
#weight this lower in importance as not always good predictor





#Property, plant and equipment


#durable competitive advantage wont need to keep replacing equipment to keep up.
#track over years; wants to be low




#Goodwill

#increase in goodwill  over a number of years assume its buying out other businesses.


#can be good if company being bought have durable competitive advantage

#if goodwill account stays same year on year, company is paying under book value or company isnt making aquisitions.

#businesses with comp adv almost never sell under  book value. incredible when it does.






#intangible assets
#internally developed cannot be shown
#aquired from a third party are shown at fair value
#hard to create logic for



#long term investments

#carried on books at cost or market price, whichever is lower
#cannot be marked above even if investments are increased in value
#can have very valuable assets without shown on paper.
#hard to create logic - way to find what company has invested in?



#Other long term assets
#not relevant


#Total assets and return on assets

#total assets = current assets + long term assets

#total assets = total liabilities + shareholder equity

#return on asset ratio = net earnings/total assets

#competitiveness can be cost required to get into industry

#capital can be barrier to entry

#really high ratio can indicate vulnerability in durability of adv

#coke has 12%,P&G has 7%, moodys has 43% - can depend on asset amount, for example moodys economics are better than
#coke but durability of advantage is worse as barriers to entry for coke are much higher - 43 billion in assets to
#compete with them is not likely, #1.7 billion for moodys is potentially viable.

#look over long term



#Current liabilities

#accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities

# not so useful for analysis



#Short term debt

#borrow long term lend short term
#ratio? for short to long term debt amounts?
# work against avg for industry?

#Long term debt due

#coming due in the current year
#good require little to no long term debt to maintain business adv
#so if lots of long term debt coming due this is bad




#total current liabilities and current ratio

#total current assets/total current liability = liquidity
#not so useful for checking adv





#long term debt
#little to none is good
#check last 10 years
#if severval years with little to none,  good bet it has adv
#LOGIC: companies on any given year should have enough net earnings per year to pay off all long term debt
#in 3-4 years
#in one year is exceptional, 2 is good
#over 4 can be disregarded
#companies with little/no debt can be targeted for buyouts; check goodwill! after buyout business then saddled with
#debt
#company bonds may be better if lots of debt but competitive adv still; possible bought out





#Deferred income tax,minority interesxt and other liabilites
#ignore deferreed income
#minority interest: when company aquires stock of another its long term investments
#if over 80% of company stock it moves to balance sheet
#interesting but not important for competitive adv
#Other liabilites not useful




#Total liabilities and debt to shareholders equity
#debt to shareholders equity ratio = total liabilities/shareholders equity
#unless looking at financial institution, any ADJUSTED (find out more) ratio
#below .80 (lower is better), good chance theres an advantage



#shareholders equity/book value
#net worth/shareholders equity/book value = total assets - total liabilities
#total assets should equal sum of total liabilities, total shareholders equity




#Preferred and common stock

#preffered stock should be 0 or lower the better
#unsure about common stock



#!!!Retained earnings!!!

#each years retained earnings added to previous years
#if loss, subtracted
#if losing money, turns negative

#!most import value on balance sheet!!!

#rate of growth of company
#create % rate of increase over the last few years
#7.9% cola, 23% berkshire hathaway





#Treasury shares (uk) or stock (usa)

#convert negative value of treasury shares into positive number and add to shareholders equity
#divide net earnings by above
#this is companies return  on equity minus  financial engineering

#presecnce on balance sheet and history of buying back shares is indicative of adv




#Return on shareholders equity!!!

#net earnings / shareholders equity = return on shareholders equity
#higher than average returns indicates adv
#20-40% is a good range, i.e. coke, wrigley
#below 10% bad
